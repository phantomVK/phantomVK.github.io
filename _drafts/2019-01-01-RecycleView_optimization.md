[RecyclerView#sethasfixedsize](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView#sethasfixedsize)

>RecyclerView can perform several optimizations if it can know in advance that RecyclerView's size is not affected by the adapter contents. RecyclerView can still change its size based on other factors (e.g. its parent's size) but this size calculation cannot depend on the size of its children or contents of its adapter (except the number of items in the adapter).
