__RealCall__ 是 __Call__ 接口唯一实现类

同步调用

```java
@Override public Response execute() throws IOException {
  synchronized (this) {
    // 限制每个Call只能调用一次
    if (executed) throw new IllegalStateException("Already Executed");
    executed = true;
  }
  captureCallStackTrace();
  timeout.enter();
  eventListener.callStart(this);
  try {
    // 立即执行Call
    client.dispatcher().executed(this);
    // 获取响应内容
    Response result = getResponseWithInterceptorChain();
    if (result == null) throw new IOException("Canceled");
    return result;
  } catch (IOException e) {
    e = timeoutExit(e);
    eventListener.callFailed(this, e);
    throw e;
  } finally {
    // 任务从同步队列中移除
    client.dispatcher().finished(this);
  }
}
```

异步调用

```java
@Override public void enqueue(Callback responseCallback) {
  synchronized (this) {
    // 限制每个Call只能调用一次
    if (executed) throw new IllegalStateException("Already Executed");
    executed = true;
  }
  captureCallStackTrace();
  eventListener.callStart(this);
  // 任务加入到异步队列中
  client.dispatcher().enqueue(new AsyncCall(responseCallback));
}
```
